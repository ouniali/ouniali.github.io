Since Winter 2019, I am a _Professeur_ of Software Engineering at [_Université du Québec à Montréal_](https://uqam.ca/) (UQAM), member of the [_Département d'Informatique_](https://info.uqam.ca/). As a researcher, I focus my effort on software composition and scalability of software design. As a teacher, I give lectures related to software engineering and software architecture.

I am currently developing the [_Abstract Composition Engine_](https://ace-design.github.io/) (ACE) to factorize knowledge about software composition and support engineers when defining new ones for their very own domain. Instead of rewriting each part of the composition from scratch in their own universe, they will be able to reuse off-the-shelf elements and customize them for their needs. Automated reasoning approaches will analyze the given artifacts and the used operators to automatically infer properties (thanks to static analysis or reference benchmark usage) on the composed system and to support its assessment in a scalable way. Such properties can be functional (_i.e._, domain-specific) or non-functional (_e.g._, associativity, idempotency).  Based on these properties, it is possible to analyze the expressed composition directives and the resulting model. The idea here is to apply approaches like query rewriting to optimize the composition directives in a scalable way.

I am on a leave-of-absence from _Université Côte d'Azur_ where I was a _Maître de Conférences_ (associate professor, 2012-2018), member of the SPARKS team in the I3S laboratory. As a teacher, I was a member of the Computer Science department of Polytech Nice - Sophia Antipolis, where I was coordinating the MSc in Software architecture.

For his exceptional Ph.D. research productivity, he was awarded the Excellence Award from the University of Montreal. He has served as a visiting researcher at Missouri University of Science and Technology, and University of Michigan, in 2013 and 2014 respectively. His research interests are in software engineering including software maintenance and evolution, refactoring of software systems, software quality, service-oriented computing, and the application of artificial intelligence techniques to software engineering. He served as a program commitee member and reviewer in several journals and conferences. He is a member of the IEEE.


### Looking for Students!

Yes, I am always looking for motivated and hard working PhD, Masters, and undergraduate students to work on challenging topics on software maintenance and evolution.
For more details, please see my research interests and my current and previous work. If you are excited and motivated to work on related topics, then send me an email with your CV, achievements, publications (if any), and a brief note explaining why you want to join my research team. I would be happy also to discuss other well thought-out research ideas!

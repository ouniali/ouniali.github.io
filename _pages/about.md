### Looking for Students!

Yes, I am always looking for motivated and hard working PhD, Masters, and undergraduate students to work on challenging topics on software maintenance and evolution.
For more details, please see my research interests and my [current](https://ouniali.github.io/research/) and [previous work](https://ouniali.github.io/publications/). 
If you are excited and motivated to work on related topics, then send me an email with your CV, achievements, publications (if any), and a brief note explaining why you want to join my research team. 
I would be happy also to discuss other well thought-out research ideas!

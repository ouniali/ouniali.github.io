During the last six years, my research effort focused on _understanding_ Software Composition. I obtained results dedicated to software composition by itself, as well as results associated with the introduction of software composition mechanisms to dedicated application domains: cyber-physical systems and service-oriented architectures.

## Model-driven Engineering and Software Composition

My research interests focus on Scalable Software Composition, using a model-driven approach to define composition operators and help software engineers while they have to design some new operators. This approach was successfully applied to heterogeneous domains such as micro-services deployment, graph databases, data collection policies and visualization dashboards.

## Cyber-physical Systems

This class of systems is interesting with respect to model-driven engineering and software composition due to their constrained essence. In this domain, I focused my effort in the definition of model-based composition operators dedicated to data collection policies and large scale sensor networks. This research is made in collaboration with researchers from other domains (_e.g._, geosciences) to experiment with real use cases.

## Service-oriented Architectures

My PhD thesis focused on a model-based approach dedicated to tame the design complexity associated to business processes modeling in Service-oriented Architectures. I applied this approach to quality of service modelling and cloud-computing deployment.

  * (2013) [A Causal Model to predict the Effect of Business Process Evolution on Quality of Service]({{base.path}}/publications/#bibqosa13)
  * (2012) [Towards CloudML, a Model-based Approach to Provision Resources in the Clouds]({{base.path}}/publications/#bibcloudmde12)
  * (2010) [Workflow Design using Fragment Composition (Crisis Management System Design through ADORE)]({{base.path}}/publications/#bibtaosd10)

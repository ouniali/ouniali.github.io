This graduate course focus on the design of Domain-Specific
Languages at the graduate level. The objective
is to reconciliate concepts coming from Language Design as well
as Modeling domains. We illustrate the course using the reactive
systems application domain, which prevents us to fall back in a
toy example pitfall.

The objective of this course is to discover what made software engineering tools, under the hood. It is an advanced and optional course that complement the “basic” package delivered during the first semester in the Project course.

The lectures will present a tool portfolio used to improve software quality (how to use it, and also how it works internally), as well as code kata to show elegant solutions to non-trivial problems. The labs relies on a programming game, where students must develop in teams (4 people each) a robot able to explore unknown islands.
